Classify newborns with size for gestational age based on sex, age at birth in weeks, and birth weight

## Installation

You can install the development version of classifynewboRns from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simpar1471/classifynewboRns")
```

## Example

`classifynewboRns` comes with several in-built datasets for you to test its functions with. These include
`bweight_centiles` and `bweight_data`. The former is used to assign size for gestational age; the latter is an example
data input which could be annotated.
```{r example_datasets}
birthweight_centiles <- classifynewboRns::bweight_centiles
head(birthweight_centiles$male, 3); head(birthweight_centiles$female, 3); head(birthweight_centiles$unknown, 3)

birthweight_data <- classifynewboRns::bweight_data
head(birthweight_data, 3)
```
Size for gestational age for newborns can be calculated using `annotate_bweight_table()`:
```{r example_annotation}
birthweight_data_sga <- classifynewboRns::annotate_bweight_table(birthweight_data)
head(birthweight_data_sga, 3)
# The number of observations of size for gestational age categories can be easily retrieved
table(birthweight_data_sga$size_for_ga)
```
You can also calculate size for gestational age for one newborn:
```{r example_sga}
classifynewboRns::get_size_for_gestational_age(sex = "male", gestational.age.at.birth = 44, birthweight.in.kg = 3.42)
```
